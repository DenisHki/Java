This is a translator program. First, type a word in English and then in Finnish. 
You can add as many words as you wish. When you finished typing the words, write "ok" and press "enter".
Now the program will ask you to write an English word and automatically translate it into Finnish if it is in your dictionary. 
In another case, the program will display "Unknown word".
